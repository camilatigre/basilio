- Voice input and assistant-like interface planned
- Future support for dashboards and scheduling integration (Google Calendar, smart home)

## 🧠 Personality

Basílio is:
- Curious, but efficient
- Sarcastic, yet helpful
- British-accented (in spirit)
- With dreams of flying (and now has a drone buddy!)
